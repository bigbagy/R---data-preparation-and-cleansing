data cleansing and preparation for linear model training
 The file [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) contains a dataframe with the same name that has 40K rows and 39 columns. Each row represents a movie title and each column represents a descriptor such as `Title`, `Actors`, and `Budget`. I collected the data by querying IMDbâ€™s API (see [www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) and joining it with a separate dataset of movie budgets and gross earnings (unknown to you). The join key was the movie title.
