# Data

A dataset that contains information about movies, including ratings, budget, gross revenue and other attributes.

> The file [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) contains a dataframe with the same name that has 40K rows and 39 columns. Each row represents a movie title and each column represents a descriptor such as `Title`, `Actors`, and `Budget`. I collected the data by querying IMDb’s API (see [www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) and joining it with a separate dataset of movie budgets and gross earnings (unknown to you). The join key was the movie title. 

# Objective

The goal is to investigate the relationship between the movie descriptors and the box office success of movies, as represented by the variable `Gross`. It can help a studio decide which titles to fund for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release a title, how much to invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information is most useful before a title is released, but it is still very valuable after the movie is already released to the public (for example it can affect additional marketing spend or how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for “second window” streaming rights).

# Instructions

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Open this file in RStudio to get started.

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x = 1:10
print(x^2)
```

Plots appear inline too:
```{r}
plot(x, x^2, 'o')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*. Enter some R code and run it.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).



# Setup

## Load data


```{r}
load('movies_merged')
cat("Dataset has", dim(movies_merged)[1], "rows and", dim(movies_merged)[2], "columns", end="\n", file="")



df = movies_merged

df$Genre <- str_split(df$Genre, ',')
genres <- unique(str_trim(unlist(df$Genre)))
is_movie_of_genre <- function(movie, genre) {
if (is.element(genre, movie$Genre)) 1 else 0
}
for (genre in genres) {
df[[genre]] <- apply(df, 1, is_movie_of_genre, genre=genre)
}


```

This creates an object of the same name (`movies_merged`). For convenience, we copy it to `df` and start using it:

```{r}
df = movies_merged
cat("Column names:", end="\n", file="")
colnames(df)
```

## Load R packages

Load any R packages that will need to use. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```


## 1. Remove non-movie rows

The variable `Type` captures whether the row is a movie, a TV series, or a game. Remove all rows from `df` that do not correspond to movies.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove all rows from df that do not correspond to movies
df2 <- df[df$Type == "movie",]
dim(df2)
```

## 2. Process `Runtime` column

The variable `Runtime` represents the length of the title as a string. Write R code to convert it to a numeric value (in minutes) and replace `df$Runtime` with the new numeric column.

```{r}
# TODO: Replace df$Runtime with a numeric column containing the runtime in minutes

#first clear n/a values, if runtime is n/a , remove row:
nalist<-NULL
totaln<- length(df2$Runtime)
for (n in 1:totaln){
   if (df2$Runtime[n]=="N/A")
   nalist<-c(nalist,n)
}
if (!is.null(nalist))
  df2<-df2[-c(nalist),]
# now df2 does not contain n/a runtime

#next change runtime from string to numeric:
totaln<- length(df2$Runtime)
for (n in 1:totaln){
  
  nruntime <- unlist(strsplit(df2$Runtime[n], " "))
  
  if (is.element("h",nruntime) && is.element("min",nruntime)){
    nhour <- as.numeric(nruntime[1])
    nmin <- as.numeric(nruntime[3])
    totalmin <- nhour*60+nmin
  }  else if (is.element("h",nruntime) && (!is.element("min",nruntime))) {
    nhour <- as.numeric(nruntime[1])
    totalmin <- nhour*60
  } else {
    nmin <- as.numeric(nruntime[1])
    totalmin <- nmin
  }
  
  df2$Runtime[n]<- totalmin
  
}

```

Now investigate the distribution of `Runtime` values and how it changes over years (variable `Year`, which you can bucket into decades) and in relation to the budget (variable `Budget`). 

```{r}
# Investigate the distribution of Runtime values and how it varies by Year and Budget

ggplot(df2,aes(x=as.numeric(as.character(Year)),y=as.numeric(as.character(Runtime)))) +geom_point()+scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 200))+coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 200)) 

ggplot(df2,aes(x=Year,y=Budget))+geom_point()

ggplot(df2,aes(x=Runtime,y=Budget))+geom_point()

```

## 3. Encode `Genre` column

The column `Genre` represents a list of genres associated with the movie in a string format. Here we write code to parse each text string into a binary vector with 1s representing the presence of a genre and 0s the absence, and add it to the dataframe as additional columns. Then remove the original `Genre` column.

For example, if there are a total of 3 genres: Drama, Comedy, and Action, a movie that is both Action and Comedy should be represented by a binary vector <0, 1, 1>. Note that you need to first compile a dictionary of all possible genres and then figure out which movie has which genres (you can use the R `tm` package to create the dictionary).

```{r}
#first find movies with na genre and remove them
nalist<-NULL
totaln<- length(df2$Genre)
for (n in 1:totaln){
   if (df2$Genre[n]=="N/A")
   nalist<-c(nalist,n)
}
if (!is.null(nalist))
  df2<-df2[-c(nalist),]

#now no NA in genre
#next find list containing all genre, glist:
glist <- NULL
totaln <- length(df2$Genre)
for (n in 1:totaln){
    gen <- unlist(strsplit(df2$Genre[n], ", "))
    glist<- unique(c(glist,gen))
}

# for every genre in glist, create a new colum in dataframe:
for (g in glist){
  colname <- g
  genrevalue<- NULL
  for (i in 1:length(df2$Genre)){
    if (grepl(g, df2$Genre[i], fixed=TRUE))
      genrevalue <- c(genrevalue,1)
    else genrevalue <- c(genrevalue,0)
  }
  df2[colname] <- genrevalue
}
#####################NOTE:this code trunck may take long time to run####################

```

Plot the relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# Select movies from top 10 most common genres and plot their relative proportions
numlist<- NULL

  for (i in 40:67){
    numlist<- c(numlist,colSums(df2[i]))
  }
numlist<-sort(numlist,decreasing=TRUE)
numlist<- numlist[1:10]
numlist<- as.data.frame(numlist)


ggplot(numlist,aes(x=numlist))+geom_bar()


#for (g in glist){
#  genrevalue<- NULL
#  for (i in 1:length(df2$Genre)){
#    if (grepl(g, df2$Genre[i], fixed=TRUE))
#      genrevalue <- c(genrevalue,1)
#    else genrevalue <- c(genrevalue,0)
#  }
#  df2[colname] <- genrevalue
#}

```

Examine how the distribution of `Runtime` changes across genres for the top 10 most common genres.


## 4. Eliminate mismatched rows

The dataframe was put together by merging two different sources of data and it is possible that the merging process was inaccurate in some cases (the merge was done based on movie title, but there are cases of different movies with the same title). There are 3 columns that contain date information: `Year` (numeric year), `Date` (numeric year), and `Released` (string representation of the release date).

Find and remove all rows that a merge error occurred based on a mismatch between these variables. To make sure subsequent analysis and modeling work well, avoid removing more than 10% of the rows that have a `Gross` value present.

_Note: Do not remove the rows with `Gross == NA` at this point, just use this a guideline._

```{r}
#  Remove rows with Year/Date/Released mismatch
rmlist<-NULL
for (i in 1:length(df2$Title)){
  #step1. parsed Year, Date and Relaesed columns and get numeric value of years
  year <- as.numeric(df2$Year[i])
  date <- as.numeric(df2$Date[i])
  release <- as.numeric(format(df2$Released[i], format="%Y"))
 #step2. for each movie, need to check 3 pairs of year values for consistency:
  #(Date,Year)
  #(Date,Released)
  #(Year, Released)
  #if there is any "na"" value in a particular pair, then assume that pair is consistent;if the difference in the pair is greater than +/- one year,  then assume that pair is inconsistent; if movie has at least one inconsistent pairs, then that movie shall be removed

  if (!(is.na(year) ||  is.na(release))){
    if (( (year+1) < release ) || ((year-1) > release) )
      rmlist<-c(rmlist,i)}
  else if (!(is.na(date) ||  is.na(release))){
    if (( (date+1) < release ) || ((date-1) > release) )
      rmlist<-c(rmlist,i)}
  else if (!(is.na(date) ||  is.na(year))){
    if (( (date+1) < year ) || ((date-1) > year) )
      rmlist<-c(rmlist,i)}

}
#step4. remove rows in dataframe according to "rmlist":
rmlist <- unique(rmlist )
if (!is.null(rmlist))
  df2<-df2[-c(rmlist),]


```
